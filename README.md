# The Web Protocol Course Episode 030 – The Lazy and Eager Grid Renderer 

* [Check Fun Evangelist Season](https://www.mgalli.com/s/evangelistcast) to see other chapters and support the project.

An educational experiment on how browsers handle **lazy vs. eager image loading**, using a simulated slow server and **Puppeteer screenshots**.

Modern browsers optimize network performance by deferring image loads until the moment they enter the viewport. Developers rely on this for faster first paints and lighter page loads.

When rendering sites (e.g. with Puppeteer for screenshots or marketing previews), those lazy images may not load in time for the screenshot. The result is broken thumbnails or incomplete renders.

How can we **simulate** this difference reproducibly—showing both the **problem** and the **fix**—without depending on remote servers or large image sets? We build a **tiny Node.js server** that streams PNGs slowly and renders two HTML pages:

* `/grid/lazy` → uses `loading="lazy"`
* `/grid/eager` → uses `loading="eager" fetchpriority="high"`

A **renderer script** captures both cases via Puppeteer, showing how lazy loading breaks rendering under automation while eager loading completes.

## 🖼️ Rendered Comparison

| Lazy (some images never loaded) | Eager (all loaded)           |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ![lazy sample](./lazy.png)      | ![eager sample](./eager.png) |


## ⚙️ Prerequisites

* **Node.js 20+**
* **Puppeteer** (installed automatically via `npm install`)
* Optional GUI requirement:
  If you run with `headless: false`, Puppeteer needs a display.
  On Linux / WSL2, set:

  ```bash
  export DISPLAY=:0
  ```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm install
node grid.mjs
# → serves:
#   http://localhost:3000/grid/lazy
#   http://localhost:3000/grid/eager
node render.mjs
```

Each image request (`/slow/img-XX.png`) streams in **random 1–15 s**, simulating unstable networks.
Compare `lazy.png` vs `eager.png` to observe how Puppeteer waits—or doesn’t—for images.


## 💡 Educational Goal

This experiment helps authors, educators, and engineers **see** why some automated renderers produce blank thumbnails, and how **loading strategy** impacts perceived completeness.
